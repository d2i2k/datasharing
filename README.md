### Study Design

Human activity recognition using smartphones experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers between 19-to-48 years of age. Each person performed six activities: i) WALKING, ii) WALKING_UPSTAIRS, iii) WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, iv) SITTING, v) STANDING, vi) LAYING, wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers (21/30) were selected for generating the training data and 30% (3/30) the test data. 

The Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

### Raw Data

The following raw data files are available for train.txt and test  files. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Feature Selection (feature_info.txt)

From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

### The instruction list/script

You may have heard this before, but [reproducibility is kind of a big deal in computational science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226).
That means, when you submit your paper, the reviewers and the rest of the world should be able to exactly replicate
the analyses from raw data all the way to final results. If you are trying to be efficient, you will likely perform
some summarization/data analysis steps before the data can be considered tidy. 

The ideal thing for you to do when performing summarization is to create a computer script (in `R`, `Python`, or something else) 
that takes the raw data as input and produces the tidy data you are sharing as output. You can try running your script
a couple of times and see if the code produces the same output. 

In many cases, the person who collected the data has incentive to make it tidy for a statistician to speed the process
of collaboration. They may not know how to code in a scripting language. In that case, what you should provide the statistician
is something called [pseudocode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode). It should look something like:

1. Step 1 - take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with parameters a=1, b=2, c=3
1. Step 2 - run the software separately for each sample
1. Step 3 - take column three of outputfile.out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set

You should also include information about which system (Mac/Windows/Linux) you used the software on and whether you 
tried it more than once to confirm it gave the same results. Ideally, you will run this by a fellow student/labmate
to confirm that they can obtain the same output file you did. 




What you should expect from the analyst
====================

When you turn over a properly tidied data set it dramatically decreases the workload on the statistician. So hopefully
they will get back to you much sooner. But most careful statisticians will check your recipe, ask questions about
steps you performed, and try to confirm that they can obtain the same tidy data that you did with, at minimum, spot
checks.

You should then expect from the statistician:

1. An analysis script that performs each of the analyses (not just instructions)
1. The exact computer code they used to run the analysis
1. All output files/figures they generated. 

This is the information you will use in the supplement to establish reproducibility and precision of your results. Each
of the steps in the analysis should be clearly explained and you should ask questions when you don't understand
what the analyst did. It is the responsibility of both the statistician and the scientist to understand the statistical
analysis. You may not be able to perform the exact analyses without the statistician's code, but you should be able
to explain why the statistician performed each step to a labmate/your principal investigator.
